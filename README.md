## Simple linear regression

````text
Y = β0 + β1 * X 
````

## Multiple Linear regression

````text
yi = β0 + β1 * Xi1 + β2 * Xi2 + ... + βp * Xip + ϵ

where, for i=n observations:
yi = dependent variable
xi = xplanatory variables
β0 = y-intercept (constant term)
βp = slope coefficients for each explanatory variable
ϵ  = the model’s error term (also known as the residuals)

## Polynomial Linear regression

````text
y = a0 + a1x1 + a2x12 + … + anx1n
