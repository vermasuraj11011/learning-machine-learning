# Random Forest Algorithm

Random Forest is a popular and versatile machine learning algorithm that is capable of performing both regression and
classification tasks. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful
model.

## How Random Forest Works:

1. **Creating Subsets of Dataset:** Random Forest starts by creating multiple subsets of the original dataset.

2. **Building Decision Trees:** For each subset, a decision tree is built. During the construction of the tree, only a
   random subset of features are considered for splitting a node.

3. **Making Predictions:** When making predictions, each tree in the Random Forest gives its own prediction and the
   final prediction is made by taking the majority vote for classification, or an average for regression.

## Advantages of Random Forest:

- **Handling Overfitting:** Random Forest reduces overfitting problem in decision trees and also reduces the variance
  and therefore improves the accuracy.

- **Handling Large Datasets:** It can handle large datasets with high dimensionality.

- **Estimating Missing Data:** Random Forest can maintain accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.

## Disadvantages of Random Forest:

- **Complexity:** Random Forest creates a lot of trees (unlike only one tree in case of decision tree) and combines
  their outputs. By default, it creates 100 trees in Python sklearn library. To do so, this algorithm requires much
  computational power and resources.

- **Longer Training Period:** Random Forest require much more time to train as compared to decision trees as it
  generates a lot of trees (instead of one tree in case of decision tree) and makes decision on the majority of votes.

## Applications of Random Forest:

Random Forest has a variety of applications, such as recommendation engines, image classification and feature selection.
It can be used to classify loyal loan applicants, identify fraudulent activity and predict diseases.

Please note that this is a general overview of the Random Forest algorithm. Depending on the specifics of your project,
you might want to add more details or examples.
