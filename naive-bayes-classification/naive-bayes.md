# Naive Bayes Classification

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary (two-class) and multiclass classification problems. It is called
naive because it assumes that each input variable is independent. This is a strong assumption and unrealistic for real
data; however, the technique is very effective for large complex problems.

## How Naive Bayes Works:

1. **Bayes' Theorem:** Naive Bayes is based on applying Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of conditional
   independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.

2. **Probability Estimation:** The algorithm estimates the probability of each class and the conditional probability of
   each class given each input value. These probabilities are estimated for new data and multiplied together, assuming
   that they are all independent (a simple or naive assumption).

3. **Class Prediction:** When making predictions, the class with the highest probability is the output class and a
   prediction is made.

## Advantages of Naive Bayes:

- **Efficiency:** Naive Bayes is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity,
  Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.

- **Handling Categorical Data:** Naive Bayes is suitable for categorical input variables that are numerically coded.

## Disadvantages of Naive Bayes:

- **Assumption of Independent Predictors:** Naive Bayes assumes that the predictors (input variables) are independent,
  rarely holding true in real-world situations.

- **Zero Frequency:** If the category of any categorical variable is not observed in training data set, then the model
  will assign a zero probability to that category and will be unable to make a prediction. This is often known as “Zero
  Frequency”.

## Applications of Naive Bayes:

Naive Bayes has been successfully used in various applications including spam filtering, text classification, sentiment
analysis, and recommender systems.
