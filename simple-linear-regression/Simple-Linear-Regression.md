# Simple Linear Regression Overview:

Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a single independent
variable (predictor) and a dependent variable (response). It assumes a linear relationship between the variables,
meaning that changes in the predictor variable are associated with proportional changes in the response variable.

Equation:

The equation for a simple linear regression model is represented as:

````text
Y = β + β1 * X 
````

In this equation, X and Y are called independent and dependent variables respectively,

β1 is the coefficient for independent variable and <br>
β0 is the constant term. <br>
β0 and β1 are called parameters of the model.

For simplicity, we can compare the above equation with the basic line equation of the form:-

````text
y = ax + b 
````

Use Case:

Simple Linear Regression is commonly used in various fields such as economics, finance, biology, and social sciences for
tasks like predicting sales based on advertising spending, analyzing the impact of a variable on another, or identifying
trends in data.

Assumptions:

Linearity: Assumes a linear relationship between the predictor and response variables.
Independence: Assumes that observations are independent of each other.
Homoscedasticity: Assumes that the variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the predictor variable.
Normality: Assumes that the residuals are approximately normally distributed.
