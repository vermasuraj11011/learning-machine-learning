# Support Vector Machine Classification

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for linear classification, non-linear
classification, and even outlier detection. It is particularly well-suited for classification of complex small- or
medium-sized datasets.

## How SVM Works:

1. **Creating Hyperplanes:** SVM works by creating hyperplanes in a multidimensional space that separates the different
   classes.

2. **Maximizing Margin:** The algorithm then tries to maximize the margin between the different classes by adjusting the
   hyperplane.

3. **Classifying New Data:** New data points are classified based on which side of the hyperplane they fall on.

## Advantages of SVM:

- **Effective in High Dimensional Spaces:** SVM is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the
  number of samples.

- **Memory Efficient:** It uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), making it
  also memory efficient.

- **Versatile:** Different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but
  it is also possible to specify custom kernels.

## Disadvantages of SVM:

- **Sensitive to Noise:** A relatively small number of mislabeled examples can dramatically decrease the performance.

- **No Probability Estimation:** SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an
  expensive five-fold cross-validation.

- **Complexity and Speed:** The algorithm is not suitable for large datasets due to its high training time.

## Applications of SVM:

SVM is used in a variety of applications including face detection, text and hypertext categorization, classification of
images, bioinformatics and handwriting recognition.
