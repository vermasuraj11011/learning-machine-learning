# Kernel Support Vector Machine Classification

Kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm that can perform linear or
nonlinear classification, regression, and even outlier detection. It is particularly well-suited for classification of
complex small- or medium-sized datasets.

## How Kernel SVM Works:

1. **Mapping to Higher Dimension:** Kernel SVM works by mapping the input data to a higher-dimensional space where a
   hyperplane can be used to separate the data into different classes.

2. **Finding the Optimal Hyperplane:** The algorithm then finds the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes with
   the maximum margin.

3. **Classifying New Data:** New data points are classified based on which side of the hyperplane they fall on.

## Advantages of Kernel SVM:

- **Handling of Non-Linear Data:** Kernel SVM can handle non-linear data by using the kernel trick to map the data to a
  higher-dimensional space where it can be linearly separated.

- **Versatility:** Kernel SVM is versatile and can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It can also be
  used for outlier detection.

- **Effective with High Dimensional Data:** Kernel SVM is effective when dealing with high-dimensional data.

## Disadvantages of Kernel SVM:

- **Computationally Intensive:** Kernel SVM can be computationally intensive, especially for larger datasets.

- **Sensitive to Overfitting:** Without proper parameter tuning, Kernel SVM can be sensitive to overfitting.

- **Choice of Kernel:** The choice of kernel and its parameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the
  algorithm.

## Applications of Kernel SVM:

Kernel SVM has a wide range of applications including image recognition, text categorization, bioinformatics, and more.
