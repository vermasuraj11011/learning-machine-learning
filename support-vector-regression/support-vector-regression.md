# Support Vector Regression

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of regression algorithm that uses the principles of Support Vector Machines (
SVM) for regression analysis. It is particularly useful for tasks where the relationship between the input variables and
the output variable is complex and non-linear.

## How SVR Works:

1. **Objective:** SVR aims to find a function that predicts the output variable (target) based on input features. The
   goal is to minimize the error of the predictions.

2. **Kernel Trick:** SVR uses a kernel function to transform the input features into a higher-dimensional space. This
   allows SVR to capture complex relationships between variables that may not be apparent in the original feature space.

3. **Margin of Tolerance:** SVR introduces a margin of tolerance around the predicted values. The model aims to fit the
   data within this margin, and any data points falling outside the margin contribute to the model's error.

4. **Loss Function:** SVR uses a loss function that penalizes errors based on how far they are from the true values. The
   loss function includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting.

5. **Hyperparameters:** SVR has hyperparameters like the choice of kernel, regularization parameter (C), and
   kernel-specific parameters. These need to be tuned to achieve the best model performance.

6. **Prediction:** Once trained, the SVR model can make predictions on new, unseen data by transforming the input
   features using the learned kernel function.

## Advantages of SVR:

- **Effective in High Dimensional Spaces:** SVR is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the
  number of samples.

- **Handling of Non-Linear Relationships:** SVR can handle non-linear relationships between variables by using the
  kernel trick to map the data to a higher-dimensional space.

- **Versatility:** Different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided,
  but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.

## Disadvantages of SVR:

- **Sensitive to Noise:** A relatively small number of mislabeled examples can dramatically decrease the performance.

- **Complexity and Speed:** The algorithm is not suitable for large datasets due to its high training time.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Proper tuning of hyperparameters is crucial for optimal performance.

## Applications of SVR:

SVR is used in a variety of applications including financial forecasting, climate prediction, and electric load
forecasting.

Please note that this is a general overview of the Support Vector Regression algorithm. Depending on the specifics of
your project, you might want to add more details or examples.
