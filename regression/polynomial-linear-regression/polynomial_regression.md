## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a
dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial. The Polynomial
Regression equation is given below:

````text
y = b0 + b1 * x + b2 * x^2 + b2 * x^3 + ...... bn * x^n
````

- It is also called the special case of Multiple Linear Regression in ML.
  Because we add some polynomial terms to the Multiple Linear regression equation to
  convert it into Polynomial Regression.
- It is a linear model with some modification in order to increase the accuracy.
- The dataset used in Polynomial regression for training is of non-linear nature.
- It makes use of a linear regression model to fit the complicated and non-linear
  functions and datasets.
- Hence, "In Polynomial regression, the original features are converted into Polynomial
  features of required degree (2,3,..,n) and then modeled using a linear model."
