# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

This project is focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human language in a valuable way.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will be working with various NLP techniques to analyze and interpret human language. The main tasks include:

- Text Processing: Cleaning and preprocessing of the text data.
- Feature Extraction: Converting text data into feature vectors that can be used as input to a machine learning model.
- Model Building: Building and training various machine learning models for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, etc.
- Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The project is implemented in Python due to its readability and vast library support for NLP and machine learning.
- NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a Python library used for working with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources.
- Scikit-learn: This is a Python library for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and install the required libraries using the following command:
